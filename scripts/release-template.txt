 * Synchronize your Tomboy notes with another computer
 * Synchronize your your PIM data to your mobile phone, iPod, 
   Nokia Internet tablet, or between computers

What Can Conduit Do:
====================
For a list of all the services that conduit supports see
 * http://www.conduit-project.org/wiki/SyncStatus

Conduit can perform one-way and two-synchronization (and conversion/transcoding)
of data between locations. In one-way sync/export conduit will only replace
exising data if the new copy has been modified. It can also optionally delete 
data if the original has been deleted.

Conduit has a complete DBus interface to allow other application authors to 
use Conduit to perform the synchronization and export tasks of their 
applications.
