Conduit.py is a small nautilus extension that allows you to use
conduit to directly upload files in a folder to a remote location.
Currently flickr, picasa and box.net are supported, but this can easily
be extended.

What you need:
* conduit trunk or anything beyond 0.3.4
* python-nautilus; to enable nautilus python extensions
* put the conduit.py file under ~/.nautilus/python-extensions
* restart nautilus

If you want to debug, help, ...  It is easier to do the following
1. mkdir ~/test
2. export TMPDIR=~/test
3. nautilus --no-desktop
