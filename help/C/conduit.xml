    <title>What is Conduit</title>
    <para>
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.conduit-project.org">Conduit</ulink> is a synchronization application for GNOME. It allows you to synchronize your files, photos, emails, contacts, notes, calendar data and any other type of personal information and synchronize that data with another computer, an online service, or even another electronic device. Conduit manages the synchronization and conversion of data into other formats. For example, Conduit allows you to; </para>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Conduit's goals are to synchronize your data as seamlessly as possible, be it from from remote device or remote websites. It is about extending your life as you see it needs to be, no longer constrained by data, devices or formats. Conduit enables you to take your data where you want when you want. All of your mobile devices could be synchronized automatically by Conduit. Home file back-ups to a remote server? Synced automatically. </para>
        <para>It may sometimes seem that Conduit is overly complicated, one of the design goals has always been to make the interface as simple and intuitive as possible. However  Conduit is much more powerful then the simplistic design may lead on. This documentation will describe all the configuration options for groups and data providers, while the following gives some examples of items you may wish to synchronize; </para>

For example, Box.net requires you to log in every time Conduit is run, whereas Flickr only requires you to log in once, to give permission to Conduit to upload photos. If you are required to log into a website, and you have selected the 'use built in web browser' from the Conduit preferences, then a window will pop up like the one shown below. </para>

        <title>Network Synchronization</title>
        <para>If you have two computers at home, Conduit can be used to synchronize the data between them, directly, without first having to store the data somewhere else first. The steps below will illustrate how to synchronize Tomboy notes on two computers, called nzjrs-desktop and nzjrs-laptop. The following key will be used to help explain the setup procedure.</para>

          <para>The process below, although describing Tomboy note synchronization, could be suitably modified to synchronize all sorts of data between two computers, including Contacts, Calendar information, and even Fspot photos.</para>

          <listitem>On the first computer create a synchronization group connecting Tomboy to the Network dataprovider, which is listed in the Miscellaneous category in the dataprovider pane. This makes tomnoy available for synchronization on the second computer.

          <listitem>Still on the second computer, drag the Tomboy dataprovider from the newly created category onto the canvas. Notice how its name is Remote Tomboy, indicating it refers to data on the remote, or first, computer

          <title>File Synchronization</title>
          <para>Due to performace and security reasons, we do not recommend using the network sync feature to synchronize large files between two computers. We hope to address this limitation in future.</para>
