class MediaFile(File.File):
    '''
    A MediaFile is a file with multimedia attributes, such as an audio or video
    file.
    
    This class includes methods to access metadata included in the file. 
    Using the GStreaner framework, it is able to retrieve most commonly used
    properties of this kind of file.
    
    Media providers can include their own data by overriding get_media_tags,
    and either providing a new set of properties, or call this class's
    get_media_tags to merge their data with the GStreamer properties.
    
    The Audio and Video classes expose these properties as convenient
    methods. Note that a descendant of this class only needs to put their
    data in get_media_tags for them to be exposed by the Audio and Video 
    classes. However, they need to follow the types and units of the GStreamer
    properties, which are described in each of their methods.
    
    Retrieving metadata through GStreamer is a costly process, because the file
    must be accessed and processed. Thus, it is only retrieved when needed, when
    the gst_tags attribute is accessed. So, accessing any metadata starts a 
    chain reaction, which starts with descendants overriding get_media_tags,
    eventually calling get_media_tags in this class, then accesses gst_tags,
    thus creating the gst metadata if needed.
