===Use Cases===
Intro
Sources are on the local machine
Sinks are on a remote machine

Two classes
1) Put local information at a remote location
Tommy wants his Evolution notes to show up on his Gmail notes page
Fred wants two folders to appear the 

2) Keep settings the same between two computers
Jimmy wants his liferea bookmarks to be the same on his laptop and his desktop
Fred wants his desktop background to be the same on his laptop and his desktop

===Objectives===
Datasources may be connected to datasinks
The transfer of data is negotiated at runtime, with the ability to autonegotiate and fallback to the lowest common supported protocol.

*All items lie on a canvas. 
*You join sinks and sources together using a connector. 
*They change colour to indicate their status, one for connected, one for synced/no sync needed, one for conflict, one for error (use traffic light metafor)
*There is a configuration button, each sink or source must have a configure function
*Each sink or source can provide a icon
